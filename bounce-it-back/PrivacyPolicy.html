    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 21, 2026</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Bounce it back</strong> ("we," "our," or "the App") handles your data. By using the App, you agree to these terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect or store any personal information such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers on our servers. Your game progress and high scores are stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services (Google AdMob)</h2>
    <p>To support this free game, we use <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob may collect and use data such as your device's IDFA (Apple) or Android Advertising ID, IP address, and app usage patterns to provide personalized advertisements.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Your Rights (GDPR & CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location (California or European Economic Area), you have the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> Since we do not store your data on servers, you can exercise this right by deleting the App from your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out (Do Not Sell My Info):</strong> You can opt-out of personalized ads via your device settings (iOS: "Limit Ad Tracking" or "Ask App Not to Track"; Android: "Opt out of Ads Personalization").</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we become aware of such collection, we will take steps to ensure it is not processed.</p>
