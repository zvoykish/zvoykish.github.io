    <h1>Privacy Policy for Bounce it back</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 23, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Bounce it back</strong> ("we," "our," or "the App") handles your data. By using the App, you agree to these terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Do NOT Collect Directly</h2>
    <p>We do not require a user account to play. We do not collect or store "Personal Information" such as your name, physical address, or phone number on our own servers. Your game progress and high scores are stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services & Data Collection</h2>
    <p>To improve the game and support its development, we use the following third-party services which may collect data automatically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob (Advertising):</strong> Used to provide personalized or non-personalized advertisements. AdMob may collect your device's IDFA (Apple) or Advertising ID (Android), IP address, and app usage patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics (Analytics):</strong> We use Firebase to understand how users interact with the App (e.g., level completion, button clicks). This data is collected anonymously and helps us identify bugs and improve gameplay. Firebase may use identifiers like your "Instance ID" to correlate events from the same device without identifying you personally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Links to Third-Party Policies:</h3>

        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase Privacy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Support Communications</h2>
    <p>If you contact us via email for support, we will receive your email address and any information you choose to provide. This information is used <strong>strictly</strong> to respond to your request and resolve technical issues. We do not use these email addresses for marketing or share them with third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Rights (GDPR & CCPA/CPRA)</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you have specific rights regarding your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> Since we do not store your data on our servers, you can exercise this right by deleting the App from your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out (Do Not Sell My Info):</strong> You can opt-out of personalized ads via your device settings (iOS: "Limit Ad Tracking" or "Ask App Not to Track"; Android: "Opt out of Ads Personalization").</li>
        <li><strong>App Tracking Transparency (iOS):</strong> The App respects your choice made via the iOS system prompt regarding activity tracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for a general audience and is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware of such collection, we will take immediate steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
